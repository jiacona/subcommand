= subcommand 1.0.4 2010-06-24 15:51 
* text for subcommands was being processed always before execution, so the
point of lazy loading was lost. I've moved it away so it's only processed if
actually printing help.

Howeve, this means that if you are relying on OptionParser's implicit --help,
that won't print subcommands. So i've added a method add_help_option which
adds a correct help option, to print subcommands. This way, command help and
command --help print identical output.
